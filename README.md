# Geekonomy - macroeconomic data quiz 

A quiz-game of guessing which country is described by displayed economic statistics. 
Data fed by WorldBank's API: https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/topics/125589-developer-information
Indicators can be explored here: https://databank.worldbank.org/source/world-development-indicators


MVP: user is presented with i.e. 5 indicators in form of graphs or raw time series and 4 country names. They have to guess which country matches the data


Nice to have:
- country (or countries if metrics for them are shown) is highlighted on the map upon clicking answer
- responsive UI
- highscores (stored on client's side?)
- mutiple quiz difficulty levels, i.e. 4 metrics 4 countries, 6 metrics 4 countries, 8 metrics 3 countries etc.
